# Week 1 — Summary

_The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery (20th Anniversary Edition)_

Short daily notes from 10–30 minutes of reading.

## 📅 Day 1 — _The introductions_

**Time:** ~20 minutes

### Description

The prologue and the first part of the book focus on the philosophy of a pragmatic programmer and on what the author aims to achieve in his work.

His ideal programmer is someone who sees the big picture, performs well, learns quickly, applies knowledge efficiently, and inspires others. Even in the introduction, he includes relevant insights about how a programmer should think.

- The first tip is to **think** during and after writing your code.
- Care about your craft. We only act when we care enough, and a pragmatic programmer doesn’t let their software go unnoticed.
- Even software built by many developers has room for individuality.
- Programming is an art, and every artist has a personal style, but pragmatic programmers share similar traits:

  - They adapt quickly, ask questions, think critically, stay realistic, and develop broad knowledge beyond their specialty.

The book also encourages readers to look for better opportunities if their current work is lacking and to study subjects they enjoy to improve their performance or open new career paths.

### Reflections

There is so much material introduced so quickly that I struggle to absorb or relate to the ideas. Honestly, I had high expectations. The solutions feel a bit too straightforward. They’re valid and helpful, but for someone truly in need of change, they might not be enough to spark transformation.

To make good use of the content, it’s necessary to reread and reflect deeply on the lines; otherwise, the ideas risk being forgotten. But since this is only the first chapter, I hope these concepts will be explored more thoroughly later on.

## 📅 Day 2 — _Some practical advices._

**Time:** 10 minutes

### Description

A team is based on trust, you need to be trustworthy and the same for your teamates for a project to work properly. When one of the parts is rotten, the project can't work properly, causing delays and revisions.

As a pragmatic programmer, you need to take responsibility for what you do, and you can also say if you want to or not take responsibility for something based on your own values.

**Don't blame others** and **don't offer excuses**. If you want to give an excuse, give it to yourself and try to see if it makes sense. At some point, you will reach a solution or possible solutions. Your work is to offer solutions to your client/boss/teammates.

If the problem is that you say you don't know, honestly, but also be honest enough to say you will learn about it. This proactiveness it's the best professional possible move.

### Reflections

I really liked today's part. The content is still very dense and needs to be read carefully, but it holds some good values. The last two pieces of advice, being honest and being a solution-based person, are very good and also logical. I'll try to apply them as soon as possible.

## 📅 Day 3 — _Software and debts_

**Time:** 10 minutes

### Description

Here is the revised version without using that punctuation mark:

The topic here is technical debt, something that ideally should not accumulate at all. The author argues that when a problem appears, it should be addressed right away, even if it means handling it alongside your current work. If you leave these issues unresolved, they will remain in place and slowly erode the quality of the project.

To illustrate this, the author uses the broken window metaphor. When people enter a place with a broken window, they tend to care less because neglect is already visible. In contrast, a well-kept environment encourages people to treat it with respect and add their code carefully.

The message is simple. Take care of your project’s broken windows before they spread and cause deeper decay.

### Reflections

I couldn't read much because of personal circumstances, but I like it at the same time. I think it is controversial because there are circumstances where this could do more harm than good in the scope of a project. Mainly in the ones you simply don't have time for, and where there aren't any unit or integration tests to make sure everything is working properly in the case of changes.

## 📅 Day 4 — _Be the change_

**Time:** 15 minutes

### Description

Today’s material can be divided into two themes: be a force for change in your project and make software good enough.

The author indirectly addresses overengineering by explaining that software should be good enough for the problem at hand. Delivering an MVP, a Minimal Viable Product, is usually more valuable than aiming for a perfect solution. A perfect project takes too long, and by the time it is finished the needs of the client will likely have changed.

When discussing being a force for change, the author introduces a helpful story. Three soldiers return from war, hungry, and arrive in a village where no one is willing to share food. The men fill a pot with water and add a few stones. Curious villagers come closer and ask what they are making. The soldiers say they are cooking stone soup, but mention that it might taste better with some carrots. A villager brings carrots. Then they suggest potatoes could add a different flavor, and someone else brings potatoes. Each time a new villager approaches with curiosity, another ingredient is added.

In the end, the pot holds a real soup filled with ingredients, and the stones are no longer important. The soldiers turned a simple idea into something richer through small suggestions.

This applies to software as well. Instead of demanding big changes, you guide others gently by proposing small improvements. You say things like this might be good with some refactoring or this part could work better with a clearer structure, and step by step, the project grows into something stronger.

### Reflections

I have to admit that even though the story about the soldiers was helpful, the concepts still feel dense, and I might end up forgetting most of what I read in this first chapter. I feel some pressure to remember everything, but the ideas do not seem very practical yet. I think that when I finish the book, I will probably have to read it again and create my own exercises so I can actually apply the principles in a useful way.

## 📅 Day 5 — _Practical habits_

**Time:** ~10 minutes

### Description

Programming is like investing. Serious investors develop habits that sustain their actions: they diversify, balance low- and high-risk assets, and regularly monitor their finances. The author encourages you to invest in your knowledge with the same consistency.

The next part is my favorite because the author turns this idea into practical steps:

* Learn a new language every year. Even if you never use some of them professionally, each one offers insights you wouldn’t gain otherwise.
* Read a technical book every month. Many people never study their field deeply, relying on shallow posts or quick courses; you need depth to grow.
* Read non-technical books as well. Communication matters, and strong soft skills make a difference.
* Take classes regularly. A course or a college program can help.
* Join local user groups and meetups, and participate actively. An online community, such as a Discord server, can also be valuable.
* Experiment with different environments. If you’ve only worked with Windows, try Linux. Try a new IDE, a new language, or a new way of solving familiar problems.
* Stay current. Follow news and posts covering technologies from different areas and people’s experiences.

The goal isn’t to accumulate trophies but to build an environment where you are truly immersed. You want a mind capable of tackling all kinds of problems, gaining insights even when you’re exploring something new. Lifelong learning leads to meaningful knowledge and long-term rewards.


### Reflections

This is by far my favorite part of the book. The author lays out the habits needed to grow more competent in the field, and I loved them so much that I’m going to start applying every one of them today.
