Short daily notes from 10–30 minutes of reading.

## 📅 Day 1 — *The introductions*

**Time:** ~20 minutes

**Description:**
The prologue and the first part of the book focus on the philosophy of a pragmatic programmer and on what the author aims to achieve in his work.

His ideal programmer is someone who sees the big picture, performs well, learns quickly, applies knowledge efficiently, and inspires others. Even in the introduction, he includes relevant insights about how a programmer should think.

* The first tip is to **think** during and after writing your code.
* Care about your craft. We only act when we care enough, and a pragmatic programmer doesn’t let their software go unnoticed.
* Even software built by many developers has room for individuality.
* Programming is an art, and every artist has a personal style, but pragmatic programmers share similar traits:

  * They adapt quickly, ask questions, think critically, stay realistic, and develop broad knowledge beyond their specialty.

The book also encourages readers to look for better opportunities if their current work is lacking and to study subjects they enjoy to improve their performance or open new career paths.

**Reflections:**
There is so much material introduced so quickly that I struggle to absorb or relate to the ideas. Honestly, I had high expectations. The solutions feel a bit too straightforward. They’re valid and helpful, but for someone truly in need of change, they might not be enough to spark transformation.

To make good use of the content, it’s necessary to reread and reflect deeply on the lines; otherwise, the ideas risk being forgotten. But since this is only the first chapter, I hope these concepts will be explored more thoroughly later on.
